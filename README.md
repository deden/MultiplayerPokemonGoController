# MultiplayerPokemonGoController

Build this project with Xcode and run on your devices. Until now, the project support up to 2 players. Additional players is possible with few update in configuration.

Using one iOS device as controller, you can control 2 devices. By using multiple player it should be easier to detect and catch Pokemons with specific teamwork method (i.e Triangulation Interception). You can add map overlays as near by marker.

This project using exported Ingress data. I've exported it to CSV. You can check this repo [ingress-exporter](https://github.com/SummerWish/ingress-exporter) to figure out how to download your map data in specific area.

Don't forget to check the python and applescript file for some background tasks.
